Linux Instructions to Build and Run

First, the SEAL library must be built. Ensure the SEAL source code is in the directory ~/SEAL
The application is assumes you are using SEAL version 3.6.1.
Run the following commands from inside the ~/SEAL directory:

cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build

To build the application, run the following commands from seal_ML directory:

The executable is now named seal_ML. It requires no command line arguments to run.
